## Should I Use MySQLi or PDO?
If you need a short answer, it would be "Whatever you like".

- Both MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:

- PDO will work on 12 different database systems, whereas MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.

- So, if you have to switch your project to use another database, PDO makes the process easy. You only have to change the connection string and a few queries. With MySQLi, you will need to rewrite the entire code - queries included.

- Both are object-oriented, but MySQLi also offers a procedural API.

- Both support Prepared Statements. Prepared Statements protect from SQL injection, and are very important for web application security.
